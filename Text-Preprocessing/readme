# 🧠 NLP Text Preprocessing Project

From raw text to meaningful vectors.  
Building strong foundations in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **core text preprocessing techniques** used in NLP pipelines.  
It focuses on transforming unstructured text into clean, meaningful, and machine-readable numerical representations.

The goal of this project is **learning and clarity**, not complexity — understanding *why preprocessing matters* before moving to advanced NLP models.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- 🔹 **Tokenization**
  - Sentence tokenization
  - Word tokenization

- 🔹 **Stop Words Removal**
  - Removing common words that add little semantic value

- 🔹 **Stemming**
  - Reducing words to their root form using Porter Stemmer

- 🔹 **Lemmatization**
  - Converting words into meaningful base forms using WordNet

- 🔹 **Bag of Words (BoW)**
  - Text vectorization using CountVectorizer

- 🔹 **TF-IDF**
  - Transforming text into numerical features based on term importance

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. Text input (raw paragraph)
2. Sentence & word tokenization
3. Text cleaning using regex
4. Lowercasing
5. Stop word removal
6. Stemming & Lemmatization
7. Feature extraction using:
   - Bag of Words
   - TF-IDF
